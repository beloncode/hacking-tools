# hackingTools

A simple collection of tools implemented in 2 days used for information gathering; reverse engineering; attack

I decided to create this project after a xpsecsecurity post! [xpsecsecurity](https://www.instagram.com/xpsecsecurity)

Two tools are missing:
- Brute Force
- Web Fuzzer

## Tools

- portScanner: A simple port scanner
- strings: A strings utility implementation
- DoS: A Denial of Service attack based on Ping of Death
- shellCode: A shell code in C
- windows-keylogger: A simple keylogger for Windows based OS
