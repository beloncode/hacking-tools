# hacking-tools
A simple collection of tools implemented in 2 days for information gathering, reverse engineering, and attack purposes

I decided to create this project after a xpsecsecurity post! [xpsecsecurity](https://www.instagram.com/xpsecsecurity)

Just two tools are missing:
- Brute Force
- Web Fuzzer

### Tools
- port-scanner: A simple port scanner
- strings: A strings utility implementation
- dos: A Denial of Service attack based in Ping of Death
- shell-code: A shell code in C
- windows-keylogger: A simple keylogger for Windows based OS
- obfuscator: A simple string obfuscator
